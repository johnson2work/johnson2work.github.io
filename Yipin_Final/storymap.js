Comprising more than 700 acres, it is highlighted by some 50 waterfalls, ranging in size 10 to more than 30 feet in height. Creation and protection of this fabulous area came about in 1978. First recommendation is to wear waterproof shoes. Second,     bring plenty of water and a few snacks. Come early morning to avoid the crowd. Do not forget to bring $4 cash for the honor box.<br><a href= 'https://i.imgur.com/TfGPehs.jpg' target='_blank'>Full Size Map</a>")

Listening to waterfalls while you kick back and relax those legs under southern sugar maple, pyramid magnolia, or chinquapin oak tree.

Time to choose your own adventure: do you do creek or trail hiking? Whoever designed the trail was a genius. Period. You have to come back again because you simply can't hike one or the other.
